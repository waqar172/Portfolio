###SIEM-Implementation-and-Log-Analysis

###Objective
This SIEM implementation lab focused on deploying and configuring a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution using Splunk on a Windows virtual machine. The goal was to monitor and detect security threats by leveraging Sysmon logs, while simulating real-world cyber attacks from a Kali Linux virtual machine using Metasploit and MSFvenom. These simulations generated security events that were analyzed to improve incident response capabilities. The hands-on project provided practical experience in using Splunk Processing Language (SPL), parsing log data, and identifying attack patterns through parent-child process relationships.
